# asterix4py
Pure python library for decoding Eurocontrol Asterix binary data.

This library tries to be an easy way to use Python as Asterix decoder without the need of a big library. Focus is currently not yet on speed but to be simple and userfriendly.
The code is based on the discontinued code from Wontor, adding missing functionalities and several bugfixes.
